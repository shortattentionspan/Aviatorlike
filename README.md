# Reverse Aviatorlike

Aviator like watchface with some color options and many other settings.

Forked from Oliver Bar's <a href="https://github.com/OliverHannover/Aviatorlike">Aviator like watchface</a>.

To build the watchface you need Garmin Connect IQ SDK and Eclipse with Garmin plugins.

This has various additions, such as
* Option to reverse hand direction. Also changes numbers (3 and 9) and battery and step gauges for round watch faces.
* Minor hand change- the simple watch hands can now have no outline
* Updated the stock yellow color (0xFFAA00) to a better 6-bit yellow (0xFFFF00). Hopefully it will not break 16-color
watches- they should just approximate to the closest color they can display
* Starting to add icons for some features, such as phone connection, messages, and alarms
* Some features can be overlaid on the watch hands instead of being obscured by the hands. This may not look
natural like a real watch, but it's useful with so much data being presentsd
* Minor code changes because features seem to have been broken by the newer SDKs

Most other features are straight from Oliver's source code, and if you like it, he has a PayPal donation link
on his <a href="https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/f0cae216-6a48-4648-b745-9c6538c8e054">Garmin store page</a>.

Hopefully the latest compiled version of my app is at (TBD- I still need to submit my app first)
